_This guide is very brief and incomplete. Feel free to fix or improve it_

==Installation==
For maven users, the easiest way to get going is to add the following repository and dependency to your project. 

_Please verify the latest version_:


{{{
<repository>
   <id>orika-snapshot</id>
   <url>https://repository-orika.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot</url>
</repository>
...
<dependency>
   <groupId>ma.glasnost.orika</groupId>
   <artifactId>orika-core</artifactId>
   <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency> 
}}}

If you do not use maven please download the latest version of the archive zip with dependencies and put it on your classpath.


Once your project configured you can start the following tutorial.

===3rd Party Dependencies===

Orika use javassist to generate byte-code dynamically. If you're downloading and installing the compiled jar in your local m2 repository rather than building from source using maven, you will not get any of the transitive dependencies



== Tutorial ==

=== Setup the mapping factory ===

The get an instance of MapperFacade initialise a MapperFactory:

{{{
MapperFactory factory = new DefaultMapperFactory();
factory.registerClassMap(ClassMapBuilder.map(Order.class,OrderDTO.class)
  .field("product.state.type.label", "stateLabel")
  .field("product.name", "productName").toClassMap());
        
factory.build();

factory.getMapperFacade();
}}}

=== Reference ====

n this example we will show you how to map from a class A to another class B and vice versa.
Let’s have a look at our domain model:

*Product (A) Source :*
{{{
public class Product {

    private String productName;

    private String productDescription;

    private Double price;

    private Boolean availability;

    // getters & setters
    
}
}}}

*ProductDto (B) Destination :*

{{{
public class ProductDto {

    private String productName;

    private String description;

    private BigDecimal price;

    private Boolean availability;

    // getters & setters
}
}}}

Note that we have explicitly chosen different and alike attributes names and types.

=== Auto mapping ===

==== Map from Product to ProductDto ====

*Result (Orika-AutoMapping) :*

Orika will automatically find all attributes with the same name and type and map them.

NB: remember that, declaring a custom mapper and/or a converter override the orika auto-mapping functionality, the byDefault() function set it  active again, this was deliberately done this way to give developers full  hands on their mapping.

{{{
// register the auto-mapping function
mapperFactory.registerClassMap(ClassMapBuilder.map(Product.class,ProductDto.class).byDefault().toClassMap());
}}}

=== Custom Mapper ===

*Let’s take now a closer look at our Dto:*

The description field in our case has nothing to do with the former one from the product class, this field is now a set of information collected from other fields, let’s say that the description should look something like this:
* Description example: The Dreamcast is a fabulous product which only cost 150
* Description in java: {{{ "The " + product.getProductName() +" is a fabulous product which only cost " + product.getPrice() }}}

For specific field we have specific treatment, in this case we will create and register a custom mapper :

{{{
// register your custom mapper
ClassMapBuilder<ProductDto, Product> builder = ClassMapBuilder.map(ProductDto.class, Product.class);
builder.customize(new MapperBase<ProductDto, Product>() {
    
// create your custom mapper                
@Override
public void mapBtoA( Product b,  ProductDto a, MappingContext  context) {
a.setDescription("The " + b.getProductName() + " is a fabulous  product which only cost  " + b.getPrice());

}});
mapperFactory.registerClassMap(builder.byDefault().toClassMap());

}}}


=== Converter ===

Let’s move now to the price, in our case we want to format the price:
  * Price in our product class is a Double
  * Price in our Dto class is a BigDecimal
For this case we need to create a converter:

{{{
// register your converter
mapperFactory.registerConverter(new ConverterBase<Double, String>() {

        // converter
    public BigDecimal convert(Double source) throws ConverterException {
        return new BigDecimal(source);
    }
});
}}}


=== Mapping fields with different name ===


Is an easy task--just point out the name of the attribute in class A and the supposed match in class B; keep in mind that the mapped attributes should be of an automatically-convertible type, otherwise you'll need to register a converter.

{{{
mapperFactory.registerClassMap(
   ClassMapBuilder.map(Product.class,ProductDto.class)
      .field("productDescription", "description")
      .byDefault()
      .toClassMap()
   );
}}}

=== Auto mapping Hints ===
In some cases, you may have a particular pattern that applies to the attributes to be mapped; or you might have some special property name mappings which are common to your whole object graph. 
You can avoid declaring multiple explicit class (and field) mappings (if you wish) by registering a *MappingHint* on the MapperFactory.

For example, suppose all of the properties on a class A have names like "name", "title", "age", etc., but the corresponding properties on another class B have names like "myName", "myTitle", "myAge", etc.
{{{
MappingHint myHint = new MappingHint() {
   public String suggestMapping(String propertyName, Class<?> fromPropertyType) { 
      if(propertyName.startsWith("my")) {
         // Remove the "my" prefix and adjust camel-case
         return propertyName.substring(2,1).toLowerCase() +
               propertyName.substring(3);
      } else {
         // Add a "my" prefix and adjust camel-case
         return "my" + propertyName.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() +
               propertyName.substring(1);
      }   
   }
}

mapperFactory.registerMappingHint(myHint);
}}}
By using this hint, you could automatically map from A to B without any explicit class mapping declaration.

The *MappingHints* registered are applied whenever the internal auto-mapping functionality is triggered, and are applied only _after_ a direct one-to-one mapping for the attribute has failed. This means that if you have any attribute names which *_do_* match exactly, the hints would not override them; hints are used to provide extra 'guesses' when the name doesn't match.

You can also pass any hints you've defined (as var-args) into the *byDefault()* method when using ClassMapBuilder to build a class mapping; like so:
{{{
MappingHint myHint = ... // same hint as defined above

mapperFactory.registerClassMap(
   ClassMapBuilder.map(A.class,B.class)
      .byDefault(myHint)
      .toClassMap()
   );
}}}


=== Nested property ===


In some cases the class we’re mapping from is not a mirror of the one we’re mapping to, attribute we’re seeking can be at a different depth, use nested property expression to access attribute at different level/depth.
We are going to introduce the order class:

An order contains only one product at a time.

Our Dto diagram contains a new attribute the orderNum which is in our case the product name.

{{{
// register the nested property expression
mapperFactory.registerClassMap(
   ClassMapBuilder.map(Order.class,OrderDto.class)
      .field("product.productName", "orderNum")
      .byDefault()
      .toClassMap()
   );
}}}

=== Collections ===

In reality an order contains a set of products:
{{{
// register product and order
mapperFactory.registerClassMap(ClassMapBuilder.map(Product.class,
ProductDto.class).field("productDescription", "description")
.byDefault().toClassMap());

mapperFactory.registerClassMap(ClassMapBuilder.map(Order.class,
OrderDto.class).field("products", "productsDto").byDefault()
.toClassMap());

}}}

You have guessed right, there is no special treatment for collections case, since it’s implicit, Orika will automatically detects the collection inside your source object and map it to the destination.

=== Bi-directional mapping ====

Let’s have a look at our bi-directional domain, 

Our dto model :

{{{
BookDto bookDto = mapperFacade.map(book, BookDto.class);
}}}

As you can see, nothing has changed, and of course the destination object will have bi-directional references as well.

=== Primitives ===

Orika will map from primitives to their respective wrapper and vice versa automatically.

=== Enumerations ===

Orika will map between the same Enum definition automatically.
Orika will also map from one Enum to another Enum so long as a matching instance name is found; if the appropriate mapping can't be determined by instance name, you can resolve this by registering a converter.

=== Inheritance ===

As of the primitives Orika detect inheritance and map automatically child and parent object.

Orika will also attempt to use an existing mapping from a parent or interface if a mapping for a child cannot be found. This means that if you have a defined mapping for A to B, and Orika is asked to map A1 (which extends A) to B, it will use the declared mapping for A to B (assuming there's no mapping for A1 to B. 

=== Object factories ===

In some cases we want to add an object factory to our mapping processing, let’s take for instance a case where we have a Person with a default address that we want Orika to add automatically whenever facing a PersonDto.
Let’s introduce the person domain’s model:
                        
Dto’s model :

{{{
public class PersonFactory implements ObjectFactory<PersonDto> {

    @Override
    public PersonDto create() {
        PersonDto personDto = new PersonDto();
        // set the default adress
        personDto.setAdressDto(new AdressDto("Morocco", "Casablanca"));
            return personDto;
    }

    @Override
    public Class<PersonDto> getTargetClass() {
        return PersonDto.class;
    }

}

}}}

Your factory must implements Orika’s ObjectFactory, then all you will have to do is to implement the create () method, and indicate the type to be expected by the object factory in the getTargetClass() method.

{{{
mapperFactory.registerObjectFactory(new PersonFactory(),PersonDto.class);
}}}

Don’t forget to register your Object factory.

NB: In sum, always remember when using orika, that it will automatically do everything for you, you should be concerned by treat only your special cases.

=== Proxy Instances ====

Orika will automatically handle proxy instances of java.lang.reflect.Proxy, as well as javassist and cglib style byte-code proxies. This handling is provided by using super-type resolution mechanism to find an accessible super-type (class or interface) from which to build a mapper. 


_more specifics needed_

== Advanced Troubleshooting (for the truly adventurous) ===
Although by default the generated classes are produced in memory only, Orika can optionally be made to write out the source and/or class files of the generated types by setting some special system properties, like so:
{{{
// Write out source files to (classpath:)/ma/glasnost/orika/generated/
System.setProperty(GeneratedSourceCode.PROPERTY_WRITE_SOURCE_FILES,"true");

// Write out class files to (classpath:)/ma/glasnost/orika/generated/
System.setProperty(GeneratedSourceCode.PROPERTY_WRITE_CLASS_FILES,"true");
}}}

----
== Summary ==

Orika attempts to provide a relatively simple and painless means to map beans from one object graph to another, while also providing performance very close to coding by hand.

It does this by generating and reusing byte-code for mappers, avoiding most of the extra processing that comes from relying on reflection.

We're not attempting to discuss whether or not to use DTOs, or whether you _should_ perform mapping between object graphs. We _are_ going to illustrate some cases in which you may need to do this mapping, and where we hope Orika can help, such as:
 * Multi layered applications
 * DDD you need for example a data mapper between bounded context
 * Converting XML binding objects to UI beans
