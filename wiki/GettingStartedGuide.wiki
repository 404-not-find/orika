_This guide is very brief and incomplete. Feel free to fix or improve it_

==Installation==
For maven users, the easiest way to get going is to add the following dependency to your project. 

_Please verify the latest version_:


{{{
<dependency>
   <groupId>ma.glasnost.orika</groupId>
   <artifactId>orika-core</artifactId>
   <version>1.0</version>
</dependency> 
}}}

If you do not use maven please download the latest version of the archive zip with dependencies and put it on your classpath.

Once your project configured you can start the following tutorial.

=== Auto mapping ===

At the heart of Orika there is the factory and the mapper facade : 

 * `MapperFactory` : maintain a registry of mappers, converters and object factories 
 * `MapperFacade` : handle all mapping operations

By default Orika copy all properties with the same name and compatible types:

{{{
...
MapperFacory mapperFactory = new OrikaMapperFactory();
MapperFacade mapperFacade = mapperFactory.getMapperFacade();

BeanA a = new BeanA();
...
BeanB b = mapperFacade.map(a, BeanB.class);

System.out.println(b);
}}}
